**mh_astro_tools — Astrophotography Tool Suite (Windows)**

mh_astro_tools is a small suite of night-vision-friendly utilities for astrophotography and astronomy.
All tools use a black-and-red interface to reduce glare and help preserve dark adaptation during an imaging session.

To make launches more comfortable in the dark, each application includes a short fade-from-black on startup to soften any brief flashes that can occur when Windows creates a new window.

**What’s included**

**Tools appear in the Launcher in this order:**

**Exposure Calculator**
Calculates recommended exposure time for deep-sky imaging using telescope/lens parameters, sensor specs, sky quality (Bortle), binning, and filter bandwidth. Includes planning estimates such as field of view, pixel scale, and limiting magnitude.

**UTC / GPS / Weather**
Displays local time and UTC, supports location entry (manual or online fetch), and provides useful planning data for sessions (timing, basic observing conditions, etc.).

**500 Rule Calculator**
Estimates the maximum shutter speed for tripod-based nightscape photography before star trailing becomes noticeable, using focal length and sensor crop factor.

**Night Vision Red Screen (Overlay)**
A red-tinted click-through overlay with adjustable contrast/black level, red intensity/brightness, and opacity—useful across the entire desktop.

**Night Vision Scientific Calculator**
A night-mode calculator with Regular and Scientific modes plus a memory panel for quick reuse of results.

**Installation (Windows)**

This release is distributed via an Inno Setup installer:

**mh_Astro_Tools_Suite_Setup_1.1.0.3.exe**

Run the installer and follow the on-screen steps.

**Shortcuts created**

The installer creates shortcuts for:

**Astro Tools Launcher**

**Astro Tools Manuals**

The suite is also added to the Start Menu (under “Astro Tools Suite”).

**Quick start**

Launch Astro Tools Launcher

(Recommended) Start Night Vision Screen at the beginning of your session

Open the tools you need for planning, timing, and calculations

Open Astro Tools Manuals for the PDF documentation

💡 **Tip:** Launching the Night Vision Screen first also helps when Windows dialogs (Browse… / Save As…) appear, because those dialogs may not follow your night theme and can be bright.

**Documentation**

PDF manuals are included with the suite in the Astro Tools Manuals folder, including the **START HERE** launcher guide.
